# üêõ Bug Fix Workflow

## Overview
Systematic debugging and fixing process to ensure reliable solutions.

## üìã Process Steps

### PHASE 1: REPRODUCTION & ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Understand the problem completely
- [ ] Reproduce the bug consistently
- [ ] Document exact steps to trigger the issue
- [ ] Identify affected components and systems
- [ ] Gather error messages, logs, and stack traces
- [ ] Determine scope and impact of the bug

### PHASE 2: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Find the underlying cause, not just symptoms
- [ ] Trace code execution path to the problem
- [ ] Identify when the bug was introduced (git history)
- [ ] Analyze related code and dependencies
- [ ] Check for similar issues in other parts of codebase
- [ ] Document the root cause clearly

### PHASE 3: SOLUTION DESIGN
**Goal**: Plan the fix before implementing
- [ ] Design the fix addressing root cause
- [ ] Consider multiple solution approaches
- [ ] Evaluate impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Plan testing strategy for the fix
- [ ] Identify regression testing needs

### PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION
**Goal**: Implement fix with proper safeguards
- [ ] Create TODO list for fix implementation
- [ ] Implement the fix incrementally
- [ ] Add defensive programming measures
- [ ] Include proper error handling
- [ ] Add logging for future debugging

### PHASE 5: TESTING & VALIDATION
**Goal**: Ensure fix works and doesn't break anything
- [ ] Test the specific bug scenario
- [ ] Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Regression testing of related functionality
- [ ] Performance impact testing
- [ ] Integration testing with dependent systems

### PHASE 6: PREVENTION & DOCUMENTATION
**Goal**: Prevent similar issues in the future
- [ ] Document the bug and solution
- [ ] Update code comments explaining the fix
- [ ] Add unit tests to prevent regression
- [ ] Update error handling patterns if needed
- [ ] Share lessons learned with team/notes

## üéØ Usage Example

```
"Follow the bug-fix-workflow.md to resolve the login issue:
- PHASE 1: Help me reproduce the exact problem
- PHASE 2: Analyze the authentication flow to find root cause
- PHASE 3-4: Design and implement the fix with proper error handling
- PHASE 5-6: Test thoroughly and document the solution"
```

## ‚ö° Emergency Fix Mode
For critical bugs: `REPRODUCTION ‚Üí ROOT CAUSE ‚Üí QUICK FIX ‚Üí IMMEDIATE TESTING ‚Üí FOLLOW-UP IMPROVEMENT`

## üîç Investigation Tools
- Code analysis and static analysis
- Logging and debugging output
- Performance profiling (if performance-related)
- Dependency analysis
- Git history and blame analysis
