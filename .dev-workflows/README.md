| `ui-ux-workflow.md` | UI/UX design and implementation | Interface improvements |
| `testing-workflow.md` | Testing and quality assurance | Ensuring code quality |
| `architecture-workflow.md` | System design and planning | Major structural changes |
| `project-management.md` | Complex project coordination | Multi-workstream initiatives |
| `quick-templates.md` | Fast templates for small tasks | Minor changes and fixes |

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use

### Method 1: Reference Workflow
```
"Please follow the workflow in `.dev-workflows/feature-development.md` to implement [FEATURE]"
```

### Method 2: Combine Workflows  
```
"Use `.dev-workflows/architecture-workflow.md` for planning, then `.dev-workflows/testing-workflow.md` for validation while implementing [TASK]"
```

### Method 3: Chain Workflows (NEW!)
```
"Follow `.dev-workflows/workflow-composition.md` to chain architecture-workflow.md â†’ feature-development.md â†’ testing-workflow.md for [COMPLEX_TASK]"
```

### Method 3: Custom Workflow
```
"Follow steps 1-3 from `.dev-workflows/feature-development.md`, then steps 2-4 from `.dev-workflows/ui-ux-workflow.md` for [TASK]"
```
