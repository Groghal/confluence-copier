# üöÄ How to Use Development Workflows

## Quick Start Examples

### üéØ Simple Feature Request
**Instead of**: *"Add a dark mode toggle"*

**Use**: *"Follow `.dev-workflows/feature-development.md` to implement a dark mode toggle"*

### üêõ Bug Fix Request  
**Instead of**: *"The login doesn't work"*

**Use**: *"Apply `.dev-workflows/bug-fix-workflow.md` to resolve the login authentication issue"*

### üé® UI Improvement
**Instead of**: *"Make the interface look better"*

**Use**: *"Follow `.dev-workflows/ui-ux-workflow.md` to redesign the main interface with better usability"*

## üîÑ Workflow Combinations

### For Complex Features
```
"Implement user profile management using:
1. Steps 1-2 from architecture-workflow.md for system design
2. feature-development.md for implementation 
3. testing-workflow.md for comprehensive validation"
```

### For Major Refactoring
```
"Refactor the data layer following:
1. architecture-workflow.md for redesign planning
2. Phases 3-4 from feature-development.md for implementation
3. testing-workflow.md to ensure no regression"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Tasks

### Small Changes
```
"Use QUICK FIX template from quick-templates.md to fix the button color"
```

### Style Updates
```
"Apply STYLE UPDATE template for updating the color scheme"
```

### Content Changes
```
"Follow CONTENT UPDATE template to update all error messages"
```

## üìã Project Management

### Large Initiatives
```
"Use project-management.md to coordinate the multi-platform deployment:
- Plan Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- Coordinate parallel development streams  
- Manage testing and release coordination"
```

### Quality Assurance
```
"Apply testing-workflow.md for the authentication feature:
- Comprehensive test planning and execution
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Performance validation and load testing"
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO
- **Reference specific workflows**: "Follow feature-development.md..."
- **Specify phases**: "Use phases 1-3 from architecture-workflow.md..."  
- **Combine workflows**: "Use X for planning, Y for implementation..."
- **Customize as needed**: "Follow workflow X but skip step Z because..."

### ‚ùå DON'T
- **Be vague**: "Use some workflow to implement X"
- **Skip planning**: "Just implement without following process"
- **Ignore testing**: "Skip the testing phases"
- **Rush through phases**: "Do everything at once"

## üîß Customization Examples

### Adapt for Your Needs
```
"Follow feature-development.md but:
- Skip Phase 1 (I've already done the research)
- Combine Phases 3-4 (implement and test together)
- Add extra documentation in Phase 5"
```

### Create Custom Workflows
```
"Create a workflow combining:
- Steps 1-2 from architecture-workflow.md  
- Steps 3-4 from ui-ux-workflow.md
- All of testing-workflow.md
For implementing the new reporting system"
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

### With TODO Lists
```
"Follow feature-development.md and create TODOs for each phase to track progress systematically"
```

### With Status Updates
```
"Use project-management.md weekly status template to track the authentication project progress"
```

## üéì Learning & Improvement

### Document Lessons Learned
After completing workflows, consider:
- What worked well?
- What could be improved?
- Should workflows be updated?
- Are new workflows needed?

### Workflow Evolution
- Update workflows based on experience
- Add project-specific variations
- Create specialized workflows for recurring patterns
- Share successful workflow combinations

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Use quick-templates.md for simple tasks to get familiar
2. **Be Specific**: The more specific your workflow reference, the better the results
3. **Combine Wisely**: Mix and match workflow phases for complex tasks
4. **Document Outcomes**: Track what works best for your project types
5. **Evolve Continuously**: Update workflows based on what you learn

**Remember**: These workflows are tools to make development more systematic and predictable. Adapt them to fit your specific needs and working style!
