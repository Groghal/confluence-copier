# üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Workflow

## Overview
Systematic approach for major architectural decisions and structural changes.

## üìã Process Steps

### PHASE 1: REQUIREMENTS & CONSTRAINTS ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Understand the full scope and context
- [ ] Document functional and non-functional requirements
- [ ] Identify performance, scalability, and security constraints
- [ ] Analyze integration requirements with existing systems
- [ ] Review technology stack limitations and opportunities
- [ ] Define success criteria and acceptance criteria

### PHASE 2: CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS
**Goal**: Understand existing architecture thoroughly  
- [ ] Map current system architecture and dependencies
- [ ] Identify technical debt and problem areas
- [ ] Document existing patterns and conventions
- [ ] Analyze performance bottlenecks and limitations
- [ ] Review code quality and maintainability issues

### PHASE 3: SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN
**Goal**: Design the target architecture
- [ ] Research industry best practices and patterns
- [ ] Design high-level system architecture
- [ ] Define component boundaries and responsibilities
- [ ] Plan data flow and communication patterns
- [ ] Design for scalability, maintainability, and testability

### PHASE 4: MIGRATION & IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
**Goal**: Plan the transition approach
- [ ] Design migration path from current to target state
- [ ] Plan incremental implementation phases
- [ ] Identify breaking changes and backward compatibility
- [ ] Define rollback and risk mitigation strategies
- [ ] Plan testing and validation approach

### PHASE 5: DETAILED DESIGN & PROTOTYPING
**Goal**: Validate design decisions with concrete implementation
- [ ] Create detailed component and interface designs
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept prototypes for critical components
- [ ] Validate performance assumptions with benchmarks
- [ ] Test integration patterns and communication protocols
- [ ] Refine design based on prototype learnings

### PHASE 6: IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING
**Goal**: Prepare for systematic implementation
- [ ] Break down implementation into manageable tasks
- [ ] Define implementation order and dependencies
- [ ] Plan team coordination and parallel work streams
- [ ] Set up development and testing environments
- [ ] Create implementation guidelines and standards

### PHASE 7: INCREMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION
**Goal**: Build the new architecture systematically
- [ ] Implement foundational components first
- [ ] Migrate existing functionality incrementally
- [ ] Maintain system functionality throughout transition
- [ ] Validate each implementation phase thoroughly
- [ ] Adjust plan based on implementation learnings

### PHASE 8: VALIDATION & OPTIMIZATION
**Goal**: Ensure the architecture meets requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of new architecture
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Security review and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Load testing and scalability validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing and feedback incorporation

## üéØ Usage Example

```
"Follow the architecture-workflow.md to redesign the data layer:
- PHASE 1-2: Analyze current data access patterns and requirements
- PHASE 3-4: Design new data architecture with proper separation of concerns
- PHASE 5: Prototype the new data layer with key components
- PHASE 6-8: Plan and implement the migration systematically"
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Don't Repeat Yourself**: Eliminate code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones

### Quality Attributes
- **Maintainability**: Easy to understand, modify, and extend
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Scalability**: System can handle increased load gracefully
- **Reliability**: System behaves predictably under normal and error conditions
- **Security**: Appropriate protection of data and operations

### Documentation Requirements
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document key architectural decisions
- **Component Diagrams**: Visual representation of system structure
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Show interaction patterns and data flow
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure and deployment considerations
- **API Documentation**: Clear interface definitions and contracts
